country_name and year. Character with 223 distinct values. Most common:

Numeric. Max = 990, min = 2, distinct = 223, mean = 411.658, sd = 259.849, NAs
= 0.</dd></p>
    <p><dt>male_suffrage</dt><dd>Virtually all male citizens are allowed to vote in
national elections. Legal restrictions pertaining to age, criminal conviction,
incompetence, and local residency are not considered. Informal restrictions
such as those obtaining in the American South prior to 1965 are also not
considered. Numeric. Max = 1, min = 0, distinct = 2, mean = 0.632, sd = 0.482,
NAs = 0.</dd></p>
    <p><dt>female_suffrage</dt><dd>Virtually all female citizens are allowed to vote in
national elections. Similar coding rules apply. Numeric. Max = 1, min = 0,
distinct = 2, mean = 0.537, sd = 0.499, NAs = 0.</dd></p>

(i.e., chosen by people who have been elected) Numeric. Max = 1, min = 0,
distinct = 2, mean = 0.641, sd = 0.48, NAs = 0.</dd></p>
    <p><dt>legselec</dt><dd>A legislative body issues at least some laws and does not
perform executive functions. The lower house (or unicameral chamber) of the
legislature is at least partly elected. The legislature has not been closed.
Numeric. Max = 1, min = 0, distinct = 2, mean = 0.741, sd = 0.438, NAs = 0.</dd></p>
    <p><dt>opposition</dt><dd>The lower house (or unicameral chamber) of the legislature is
(at least in part) elected by voters facing more than one choice. Specifically,
parties are not banned and (a) more than one party is allowed to compete or (b)
elections are nonpartisan (i.e., all candidates run without party labels)
Numeric. Max = 1, min = 0, distinct = 2, mean = 0.594, sd = 0.491, NAs = 0.</dd></p>
    <p><dt>competition</dt><dd>The chief executive offices and seats in the effective
legislative body are filled by elections characterized by uncertainty (see
Przeworski 2000: 16- 17), meaning that the elections are, in principle,
sufficiently free to enable the opposition to gain power if they were to
attract sufficient support from the electorate. This presumes that control over
key executive and legislative offices is determined by elections, the executive
and members of the legislature have not been unconstitutionally removed, and
the legislature has not been dissolved. With respect to the electoral process,
this presumes that the constitutional timing of elections has not been violated
(in a more than marginal fashion), non-extremist parties are not banned,
opposition candidates are generally free to participate, voters experience
little systematic coercion in exercising their electoral choice, and electoral
fraud does not determine who wins. With respect to the outcome, this presumes
that the declared winner of executive and legislative elections reflects the
votes cast by the electorate, as near as can be determined from extant sources.
Incumbent turnover (as a result of multi-party elections) is regarded as a
strong indicator of competition, but is neither necessary nor sufficient. In
addition, we rely on reports from outside observers (as reported in books,
articles, and country reports) about whether the foregoing conditions have been
met in a given election (see Svolik 2012: 24). Coding for this variable does
not take into account whether there is a level playing field, whether all
contestants gain access to funding and media, whether media coverage is
unbiased, whether civil liberties are respected, or other features associated
with fully free and fair elections. COMPETITION thus sets a modest threshold.
Numeric. Max = 1, min = 0, distinct = 2, mean = 0.349, sd = 0.477, NAs = 0.</dd></p>
    <p><dt>lexical_index</dt><dd>To generate the lexical index from these six binary
variables, a country-year is assigned the highest score (L0-6) for which it
fulfills all requisite criteria, as follows:</p>

    <p>L1: LEGSELEC=1 or EXSELEC=1.</p>

    <p>L5: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1 &amp; COMPETITION=1 &amp; (MALE SUFFRAGE=1 or
FEMALE SUFFRAGE=1).</p>
    <p>L6: LEGSELEC=1 &amp; OPPOSITION=1 &amp; EXSELEC=1 &amp; COMPETITION=1 &amp; MALE SUFFRAGE=1 &amp;
FEMALE SUFFRAGE=1. Numeric. Max = 6, min = 0, distinct = 7, mean = 2.783, sd =

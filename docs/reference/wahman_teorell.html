    <p>The codebook notes:</p>
    <p>Using the mean of the Freedom House and Polity scales (ifhpol), we draw the
line between democracies and autocracies at 7.0. We chose his threshold value
by estimating the mean cutoff point separating democracy from autocracy in five
well-known categorical measures of democracy: Cheibub et al. (2010), Boix et al
(Forthcoming) and Bernhard et al. (2001), together with Polity&#39;s own
categorical threshold for &quot;democracy&quot; and Freedom House&#39;s threshold for
&quot;Electoral Democracy.&quot; At the core of our typology of authoritarian regime
types is a distinction between three different modes of political power
maintenance (probably the three most widely used throughout history):</p>
    <p>1. Hereditary succession, or lineage, corresponding to Monarchies; we define
monarchies as those regimes in which a person of royal descent has inherited
the position of head of state in accordance with accepted practice and/or the
constitution (one cannot proclaim oneself a monarch). It bears stressing that
we only apply this classification to countries where the sovereign exercises
real political power; ceremonial monarchies are thus excluded. This occurs in
Afghanistan 1979 and 2001, Bosnia-Herzegovina 1995, Cambodia 1979, Lebanon
1990, and Solomon Islands 2003. Users particularly interested in the
time-series information on democracy for these countries should consider more
case-specific imputation techniques.</p>
    <p>2. The actual or threatened use of military force, referring to Military
regimes, where the armed forces may exercise political power either directly or
indirectly (i.e., by controlling civilian leaders behind the scenes). Regimes
where persons of military background are chosen in open elections (which have
not been controlled by the military) thus should not count as military. &quot;Rebel
regimes&quot; form a special subcategory. They include cases where a rebel movement
(one not formed out of the regular armed forces) has taken power by military
means, and the regime has not as yet been reconstituted as another kind of
regime.</p>
    <p>3. Popular elections, designating the various electoral regimes. We distinguish
among three basic types of electoral regimes. The first is the No-Party Regime,
where elections are held but all political parties (or at least any candidate
representing a party) are prohibited. Elections in no-party regimes may display
an element of competition, but thus only among individual candidates.</p>
    <p>Second, in One-Party Regimes, all parties but one is forbidden (formally or de
facto) from taking part in elections. A small number of non-party candidates
may also be allowed to take part and get elected; there may be satellite
parties which are autonomous in name, but which cannot take an independent
position; and competition between candidates from the same (ruling) party may
also obtain; we still code the regime one-party. It is not enough, moreover,
that a regime calls itself a one-party state; elections in such a structure
must also be held.</p>
    <p>Third, and finally, we define Limited Multiparty regimes as regimes that hold
parliamentary or presidential elections in which (at least some) candidates are
able to participate who are independent of the ruling regime. This
classification holds even when opposition parties refrain voluntarily from
taking part in elections. It also embraces cases where parties are absent, but
where this is not the result of any prohibition against party activities: the
candidates in question have simply chosen to stand for election as individuals.
These latter we classify as Party-Less limited multiparty systems.</p>
    <p>Finally, we have a residual category called others, including a few cases that
do not fit under any other regime type, given the definitions applied.</p>
    <p>The categories in regime1ny are not mutually exclusive. All monarchical regimes
with amalgams [regimeny=16, 17, 23 or 24] are treated as monarchies, all
military regimes with sub-types and amalgams [regimeny=4, 5, 6, 7 or 18] are
treated as military regimes, and multiparty regimes with sub-types are treated
as multiparty regimes [regimeny =1 or 2]. Only pure no-party [regimeny=3] and
one-party [regimeny=8] regimes are treated as no-party and one-party regimes,
respectively. The minor types [regimeny=9, 19, 20, 21, 22] are treated as
other. Our regime classification pertains to December 31 as of each year.
Factor with 13 levels. Most common: Monarchy (482), Military (956), One-party
(821), Multi-party (1307), No-party (36), Other (253), Democracy (2838). NAs =
0.</dd></p>

Multiparty Monarchy 100 Democracy</p>
    <p>The codebook notes: Based on the classifications in regime1ny we also code
hybrids (or amalgams) combining elements from more than one regime type.
Monarchies may carry out elections in various forms: multiparty elections,
no-party elections, and also one-party elections. The same goes for military
regimes. In addition to the main types and their amalgams, we have identified
several minor types of authoritarian regime. In a theocracy, decisive political
power lies in the hands of a religious elite. Temporary regimes, the purpose of
which is to carry out a transition, are classified as transitional regimes.
There are furthermore countries in which the official government does not in
reality control the territory. This may be due to civil war or occupation by
foreign troops. Factor with 20 levels. Most common: limited multiparty (1306),
military trad (423), military multiparty (202), military one-party (208),
one-party (821), monarchy (238), democracy (2838). NAs = 0.</dd></p>

    <p><dt>vanhanen_competition</dt><dd>Index of competition from Vanhanen 2012. From
Vanahnen&#39;s documentation: &quot;The smaller parties&#39; share of the votes cast in
parliamentary or presidential elections, or both, is used to indicate the
degree of competition. It is calculated by subtracting the percentage of votes
won by the largest party from 100. If the largest party gets, for example, 40
percent of the votes, the share of the smaller parties is 60 percent. If data
on the distribution of votes are not available, the value of this variable is
calculated on the basis of the distribution of seats in parliament. The
distribution of seats is used also in cases in which it seems to indicate power
relations more realistically than the distribution of votes.&quot; Its maximum value
is 70. See the full documentation for Vanhanen&#39;s dataset for details. Numeric.
Max = 70, min = 0, distinct = 695, mean = 25.217, sd = 25.171, NAs = 8440.</dd></p>
    <p><dt>vanhanen_democratization</dt><dd>Index of democratization from Vanhanen 2012.
Higher values are more democratic. Constructed multiplicatively from
vanhanen_participation and vanhanen_competition. Numeric. Max = 49, min = 0,
distinct = 446, mean = 8.434, sd = 11.676, NAs = 8440.</dd></p>
    <p><dt>vanhanen_participation</dt><dd>Index of participation from Vanhanen 2012. From
Vanahnen&#39;s documentation: &quot;The percentage of the population which actually
voted in the same elections is used to measure the degree of participation (=
Participation). This percentage is calculated from the total population, not
from the adult or enfranchized population.&quot; It is zero by construction in cases
where no popular elections exist. May be modified by referenda. See the full
documentation of Vanhanen&#39;s dataset for details. Numeric. Max = 71, min = 0,
distinct = 761, mean = 21.099, sd = 21.877, NAs = 8440.</dd></p>

democracy,polity,"Combined Polity Score. The codebook says this: ""The POLITY score is computed by subtracting the AUTOC score from the DEMOC score; the resulting unified polity scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic). Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY ""spectrum"" is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score. Investigations involving hypotheses of varying effects of democracy and/or autocracy should employ the original Polity scheme and test DEMOC and AUTOC separately.""",NA,NA,NA,NA

The change (+12) would be prorated over the intervening three years at a rate of per year, so that the converted scores would be as follows: 1957 -7; 1958 -4; 1959 -1; 1960 +2; and 1961 +5.

With respect to the outcome, this presumes that the declared winner of executive and legislative elections reflects the votes cast by the electorate, as near as can be determined from extant sources. Incumbent turnover (as a result of multi-party elections) is regarded as a strong indicator of competition, but is neither necessary nor sufficient.

PIPE,f,"Franchise. Qualifications for the right to vote in national elections. The codebook notes: To account for exclusions not captured under f, we use the variable oth_exclusions (see below).


There are cases of coexisting qualifications. We handle them as follows:


(1) If the qualifications differ by ethnicity or religion (common in colonies), we code the least restrictive qualification for non-colonizers.


(2) If the qualifications are set at a sub-national level, we code the variable as missing. (Unified countries in which franchise is regulated by sub-units include the United States, Mexico, or South Africa before 1968, while cases of countries that were not yet politically unified include Argentina before 1853, South Africa before 1910, and Australia before 1901). Regulations concerning immigrants and foreign residents are not considered.

Coding of franchise:


missing before suffrage was instituted for the first time.


The codes 0 to 7 are for males only:


0 No legal provisions for suffrage. This code is applied (a) whenever constitutions or other legal acts providing for suffrage were either abrogated without being replaced or formally suspended, (b) if (a) is unclear, whenever the legislature was closed and neither legislative nor presidential elections were held.


1 Estate representation. Example: Sweden until 1866.


2 Property only.


3 (Property OR income OR taxes OR exercise of profession OR educational titles) AND literacy.


4 Property OR income OR taxes OR exercise of profession OR educational titles. This code applies whenever the law specifies a minimum threshold, even if this threshold is very low (for example, tax contribution of three days of local wages in France in 1789, as long as this requirement is observed. If it is not observed, as in post-1917 Mexico, the code is 6.


5 Literacy only OR (Literacy OR property OR income OR taxes OR exercise of profession OR educational titles). 6 All the economically independent (not personal servants, not debtors, only residence requirement). Includes: (a) phrases that explicitly refer to economic independence. Example: ""Tener una propiedad, o ejercer cualquiera profesion, o arte con titulo publico, u ocuparse en alguna industriautil, sin sujecion a otro en clase de sirviente o jornalero."" (Peru in 1823) (b) phrases such as known means of subsistence, ""honest livelihood."" Example: ""Son ciudadanos todos los habitantes de la Republica naturales de pais o naturalizados en el que fueren casados, o mayores de diez y ocho anos, siempre que exerzan alguna profesion util o tengan medios conocidos de subsistencia."" (Costa Rica 1824) (c) phrases that suggest clearly broad qualifications. Example: ""Son ciudadanos todos los salvadorenos mayores de veintiun anos que sean padres de familia, o cabezas de casa, o que sepan leer y escribir, o que tengan la propiedad que designa la ley."" (El Salvador 1841) (d) cases where suffrage is universal but only for free men (i.e., not slaves) (e) cases that fall under 4 without explicit thresholds. Examples: Romania 1866, Peru 1860. The French constitutions of 1795 and 1799 required ""une contribution quelquonque."" The 1860 Peruvian constitution qualified anyone who could read and write OR paid any taxes OR owned a workshop OR owned some land. The last provision was intended to allow the indigenous population to vote. (f) cases in which franchise is declared to be universal but excludes those who have failed to pay taxes or those permanently receiving public assistance or those under legal bankruptcy.


7 All (""Manhood""). The only exclusions admitted in this category are: (1) having been convicted of a crime (2) being legally incompetent (3) short, less than two-year local residence requirement. There are some cases, however, where the law contains restrictive phrases, such as the requirement of appearing on the tax rolls or having fulfilled military obligation, these restrictions were not enforced. In such cases franchise was coded as 7. An example is the Ottoman Constitution of 1876 (in force after 1908) or the Swedish law until 1975.


For females, we use the second digit, distinguishing only situations in which


0 if no women can vote


1 women are qualified on narrower basis than males Examples: (a) in England between 1918 and 1927 males were qualified at the age of 20, females at 25. (b) in Canada between 1917 and 1920 the vote was given only to relatives of military. (c) in some countries women voted only in some regions. Note that if females vote in municipal elections, we do not include it since the codes refer only to national elections.


2 women are qualified on the same basis as males.


This is missing if there is more than one constitution, any other kind of political chaos that makes the electoral rules inoperative.

The codebook notes: Whenever there are no such provisions but a legislature exists, the actual mode of selection is coded. These provisions are coded whether or not the legislature in fact exists, as long as they have not been formally abrogated or suspended.

Rows distinguish elected vs. appointed legislatures. Ex-officio members are considered as appointed. Columns specify whether or not there are distinct electorates (whether people living next to each other vote for the same seats) and/or whether the appointed seats are distributed among some categories.

The coding entails two levels. At the first level, as represented by integers, we indicate whether the legislature was fully appointed, partially appointed and partially elected, or fully elected, and whether either those appointed or the voters were distinguished according to some criteria. In cases of partly elected and partly appointed legislatures, the first decimal indicates whether distinctions apply to the electorate or to the appointed position. In cases where at least some members are appointed, the second decimal provides information whether appointments resulted from delegation from below or nomination from above. Thus, for example, in Austria between 1848 and 1877, voters were divided into curiae according to property criteria: we code this case as 10. In Jordan, the legislature was elected except for two seats reserved for Bedouins, who were appointed: the code is 7.01 since the legislature was partially appointed (7) and the representatives were nominated from above (0.01). Finally, in Fiji in 1929, Europeans and Indo-Fijians were elected by separate electorates, while Fijians were appointed by the chiefs: we code is as 7.12 since the legislature was partially appointed (7), the distinction by race/ethnicity applied to voters (0.1), and the appointed representatives were delegates (0.02). We ignore functional bodies such as in Yugoslavia 1974 and therefore code them as missing. If there is a functional body along with territorial body, we focus on the latter. Quotas, such as that some proportion of the legislature must be female, are not considered unless there are separate electorates for male and female seats.

None means that there are no constitutional provisions for a legislature and no legislature in fact. * Accompanied by a decimal as follows: 0.1 if distinctions apply to the electorate 0.2 if distinctions apply to the appointed positions 0.3 if distinctions apply both to the electorate and the appointed positions & Accompanied by a centecimal as follows: 0.01 appointed from above 0.02 appointed from below 0.03 some are appointed from above and some are appointed from below In addition to these codes, assemblies based on estate representation are coded as 13. Estate assemblies were bodies divided into three of more chambers, each of which contained representatives (or indeed all members appearing personally) of one, and only one, legally privileged status group or estate such as the nobility, the clergy, and the burghers of the self-governing towns. (Ertman 1997: 21) An estate, in turn, may be defined as a group of people having the same status in the sense in which that word is used by lawyers. A status in this sense is a position to which is attached a bundle of rights and duties, privileges and obligations, legal capacities and incapacities, which are publicly recognized and which can be defined and enforced by public authority and in many cases by courts of law.

PIPE,coups,"Number of successful coups d'etat during a given year. The codebook notes:

Note: A coup is any event resulting in an irregular removal or resignation of the chief executive that involves a violent action or an explicit threat of resorting to it, by an armed organization. Assassinations of the chief executive are not considered coups unless the group responsible for the action takes over the office. Whenever the rules about the replacement of the chief executive are either not codified or unclear, the force criterion prevails. The definition excludes resignations under pressure of popular mobilization if no armed group (legal or not) is involved (resignation of Carlos Mesa in Bolivia). Similarly, irregular transfers of power among civilians that do not entail force (such as changes of communist leaders) are not considered coups. We place no restriction on whether the armed group causing the replacement is domestic or foreign, nor on the identity of the incoming ruler. In particular, any military intervention of foreign powers producing a replacement of the chief executive is coded as a coup, even if they restore a previously elected ruler (French troops overthrowing Bokassa in Central African Republic). As a general rule, any replacement of a military chief executive by another military man is considered a coup, unless the succession occurred according to pre-established rules (Figueirido replacing Geisel in Brazil). Specifically, resignations of the military chief executive caused by votes of non-confidence of irregular military bodies are considered coups (Galtieri replacing Viola in Argentina). The variable is compatible to other conventional sources such as Powell and Thyne (2010), Marshall and Marshall (2009), and Svolik and Akcinaroglu (2010) for the period 1950-2008, with some difference in the interpretation of specific events.

The codebook says this: ""The POLITY score is computed by subtracting the AUTOC score from the DEMOC score; the resulting unified polity scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic). Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY ""spectrum"" is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score.

The codebook notes:


Using the mean of the Freedom House and Polity scales (ifhpol), we draw the line between democracies and autocracies at 7.0. We chose his threshold value by estimating the mean cutoff point separating democracy from autocracy in five well-known categorical measures of democracy: Cheibub et al. (2010), Boix et al (Forthcoming) and Bernhard et al. (2001), together with Polity's own categorical threshold for ""democracy"" and Freedom House's threshold for ""Electoral Democracy."" At the core of our typology of authoritarian regime types is a distinction between three different modes of political power maintenance (probably the three most widely used throughout history):


1. Hereditary succession, or lineage, corresponding to Monarchies; we define monarchies as those regimes in which a person of royal descent has inherited the position of head of state in accordance with accepted practice and/or the constitution (one cannot proclaim oneself a monarch). It bears stressing that we only apply this classification to countries where the sovereign exercises real political power; ceremonial monarchies are thus excluded. This occurs in Afghanistan 1979 and 2001, Bosnia-Herzegovina 1995, Cambodia 1979, Lebanon 1990, and Solomon Islands 2003. Users particularly interested in the time-series information on democracy for these countries should consider more case-specific imputation techniques.


2. The actual or threatened use of military force, referring to Military regimes, where the armed forces may exercise political power either directly or indirectly (i.e., by controlling civilian leaders behind the scenes). Regimes where persons of military background are chosen in open elections (which have not been controlled by the military) thus should not count as military. ""Rebel regimes"" form a special subcategory. They include cases where a rebel movement (one not formed out of the regular armed forces) has taken power by military means, and the regime has not as yet been reconstituted as another kind of regime.


3. Popular elections, designating the various electoral regimes. We distinguish among three basic types of electoral regimes. The first is the No-Party Regime, where elections are held but all political parties (or at least any candidate representing a party) are prohibited. Elections in no-party regimes may display an element of competition, but thus only among individual candidates.

Second, in One-Party Regimes, all parties but one is forbidden (formally or de facto) from taking part in elections. A small number of non-party candidates may also be allowed to take part and get elected; there may be satellite parties which are autonomous in name, but which cannot take an independent position; and competition between candidates from the same (ruling) party may also obtain; we still code the regime one-party. It is not enough, moreover, that a regime calls itself a one-party state; elections in such a structure must also be held.

Third, and finally, we define Limited Multiparty regimes as regimes that hold parliamentary or presidential elections in which (at least some) candidates are able to participate who are independent of the ruling regime. This classification holds even when opposition parties refrain voluntarily from taking part in elections. It also embraces cases where parties are absent, but where this is not the result of any prohibition against party activities: the candidates in question have simply chosen to stand for election as individuals. These latter we classify as Party-Less limited multiparty systems.

Finally, we have a residual category called others, including a few cases that do not fit under any other regime type, given the definitions applied.

The categories in regime1ny are not mutually exclusive. All monarchical regimes with amalgams [regimeny=16, 17, 23 or 24] are treated as monarchies, all military regimes with sub-types and amalgams [regimeny=4, 5, 6, 7 or 18] are treated as military regimes, and multiparty regimes with sub-types are treated as multiparty regimes [regimeny =1 or 2]. Only pure no-party [regimeny=3] and one-party [regimeny=8] regimes are treated as no-party and one-party regimes, respectively. The minor types [regimeny=9, 19, 20, 21, 22] are treated as other. Our regime classification pertains to December 31 as of each year.","A selection from the Authoritarian Regimes Data Set, v. 5.0","The Authoritarian Regimes Data set by Axel Hadenius, Jan Teorell, & Michael Wahman, described in Hadenius, Axel & Jan Teorell. 2007.

The codebook notes:  Based on the classifications in regime1ny we also code hybrids (or amalgams) combining elements from more than one regime type. Monarchies may carry out elections in various forms: multiparty elections, no-party elections, and also one-party elections. The same goes for military regimes. In addition to the main types and their amalgams, we have identified several minor types of authoritarian regime. In a theocracy, decisive political power lies in the hands of a religious elite. Temporary regimes, the purpose of which is to carry out a transition, are classified as transitional regimes. There are furthermore countries in which the official government does not in reality control the territory. This may be due to civil war or occupation by foreign troops.",NA,NA,regime types,"Wahman, Michael, Jan Teorell, and Axel Hadenius. 2013.
